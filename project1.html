        <p style="color: black; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
            The main colors on this webpage are blue and yellow, which are not one of the harmonious combinations we
            discussed in class. They're both primary colors, and are close to being complementary, but are not. These
            two colors give the site a very joyful and high-energy mood, something a kid would enjoy. It makes sense
            that the designers would do this, as Nesquik is a drink that is tailored towards children.
        </p>

        <div
            style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 40px; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img style="width: 700px" src="images/nesquik2.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p style="color: black; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
            The goal of this recreation was to make the Nesquik page appeal more to adults, the people who are going to
            be accessing the page to buy the drinks for their children. Because of this, I strayed away from the harsh
            two-tone in the original page and went with a blue theme with a yellow accent. I also made the page more
            simplistic, fitting a more modern theme.

        <div
            style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 40px; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img style="width: 700px" src="images/nesquik3.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p style="color: black; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
            This first modified recreation uses the same simple, more modern approach to the webpage, but has no main
            color theme. It uses a lot of white, and interchanges its use of yellow and blue for accents and main
            colors. Overall, it still appeals a lot more to older ages, but the addition of the extra yellow could fit
            in more with a teen crowd as it gives more life to the site.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-left: 20px; text-align: center;">Modified Recreation #2</h3>
        <div
            style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 40px; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img style="width: 700px" src="images/nesquik4.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p style="color: black; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
            This recreation tries to keep the yellow theme of the original page and the blue accent, but keeping the
            site way more clean and easy to read. This can appeal to a lot of age ranges, as the yellow brings an upbeat
            tone that appeals to younger generations, but the clean layout of the site can appeal to older ages.
            However, I think this fits into more of a young adult vibe, with the bright colors and minimalist style.

        <h3 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-left: 20px; text-align: center;">Modified Recreation #3</h3>
        <div
            style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 40px; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img style="width: 700px" src="images/nesquik5.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p style="color: black; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
            This last recreation incorporates ideas from every redesign up to this point: sleek, blue theme, yellow
            accent, appeals to multiple age groups. However, the yellow navbar makes the yellow accent pop out a lot
            more compared to recreation #1. This keeps the nice blue theme of the first recreation, but adds a warm
            color of yellow to keep the user's eyes locked on the screen, and more importantly specific details on the
            screen. Having a warm color for a navbar can be great for immediately bringing the user's attention to the
            fact that there is a simple navigation service on the site.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-left: 20px; text-align: center;">Best Color Scheme</h3>
        <p style="color: black; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
            In my opinion, the initial recreation is the most effective color scheme. The blue theme with yellow accents
            looks extremely clean and modern, which is important in the current web sphere. The playful font keeps the
            children-centric nature of the brand, but the layout appeals to young adults and parents. This is the scheme
            that looks the most appealing to the eye, and also appeals to multiple target groups the best.
