        <p style="color: black; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
            This chapter dove into the two most important characteristics of good design: discoverability and understanding. 
            I chose understandability as my summarizer word instead of discoverability because I think it better represents 
            the purpose of good design in my eyes, which is to facilitate the easiest use possible by someone who has no idea 
            what a product does. A product needs to be easy to understand; users shouldn't have to spend more than a few seconds 
            figuring out what a product does. While discoverability is important in the sense that users should know what a product 
            is able to do, the main importance should be understanding what it's meant to do. Using concepts such as affordances and 
            signifiers facilitate a greater user understanding of a product upon first glance. Understandability is extremely important 
            for my career because I am most likely going to become a software engineer, meaning I'm going to be developing websites. It 
            is important that I make these websites as easy to navigate for the user as possible, meaning every part of the site should 
            have a clear function that's easy to understand upon first glance. Even if I'm not designing the layouts for the websites, 
            it is still a great skill to know how to think like a person using my site and try to identify design flaws that could trick them.
