            This reading can be characterized by the word navigation because it explains the aspects of navigating
            through a web page, and the do's/dont's of the process. The web navigation process starts with a user
            normally trying to find something. They decide whether to ask first or browse first. If they choose to
            browse, they make their way through a hierarchy, using signs to guide them. Eventually, if they can't find
            what they're looking for, they leave. This highlights the unbearable lightness of browsing: there's no sense
            of scale, direction, or location. The purpose of navigation is to help us find what we're looking for, tell
            us where we are, tell us what's here, tell us how to use the site, and give us confidence in the people who
            built it. This is done by using common web navigation conventions such as sections, site location
            indicators, page names, local navigation, and more. You can test if a site is easy to navigate by using the
            trunk test and asking these questions: What site is this? What page am I on? What are the major sections of
            this site? What are my options at this level? Where am I in the scheme of things? How can I search? These
            concepts are important for me to understand in my career because I am aspiring to become a software
            engineer, specifically working in the web space, so I need to know these web navigation rules in order to
            create the best possible websites for my users.
