            The reading for Chapter 2 revolved around the role of the designer being to bridge the gap
            between two gulfs of a product: the desired outcome and available options. Feedback and good
            conceptual modeling help bridge the Gulf of Evaluation. Conceptual models are often
            constructed from fragmentary evidence with a poor understanding of what's happening, creating
            a difficult user design in the end. When users process an object to evaluate what its purpose
            could be, they are going through one of three levels of processing: Visceral, Behavioral, and
            Reflective. Visceral is making quick responses without full awareness, Behavioral is learned
            reactions to situations, and Reflective is deep understanding and reasoning. Product designs
            should be aware of all three of these processing levels, and fulfill the requirements for the user
            to engage in them all.

                This sketch meets guidelines stated in my paragraph above in many ways. Users will quickly
                understand the navigation of the app, as there is a scroll bar and easy-to-understand buttons.
                This fits in the Visceral requirement. Behavioral is met because this layout looks similar to most
                modern social media sites. Finally, Reflective will be met as the app is used because moving
                throughout a site with this type of layout is simple and quick.
