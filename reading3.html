        <p style="color: black; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-top: 20px;">
            This reading was over chapters 2-5 of the book Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug. The ideas in these
            chapters revolved around the idea that design should be as easy for the user to navigate as possible. There
            are a lot of elements that create ease of design like this. In chapter 2, Krug emphasizes that people scan
            pages rather than read them. Users already have a plan when they enter a website, so the website needs to
            know this and give them links immediately that can help them reach their destination. Chapters 3 and 4 focus
            on making sure the users see and understand as much of what they need to as possible, which includes these
            rules: take advantage of conventions, create effective visual hierarchies, break pages up into clearly
            defined areas, make it obvious what's clickable, eliminate distractions, and format content to support
            scanning. User's don't mind clicking through pages, so long as each click is painless and they have
            continued confidence that they're on the right track. Some assistance may be required, but that guidance
            works best when it's brief, timely, and unavoidable. Finally, chapter 5 focuses on text and wording as a
            whole, starting off stating that needless words should always be omitted. Krug states that most web pages
            have words that just take up space because no one's ever going to read them. Getting rid of useful words has
            several benefits: reducing noise level on a page, making the useful content more prominent, making the pages
            shorter, and allowing the user to glance without scrolling. My favorite quote from these chapters was Krug
            saying “happy talk must die” because it's so true: introductory text is a waste of the user's time and
            space.

                This sketch meets guidelines stated in my paragraph above in many ways. Users will quickly
                understand the navigation of the app, as there is a scroll bar and easy-to-understand buttons.
                This fits in the Visceral requirement. Behavioral is met because this layout looks similar to most
                modern social media sites. Finally, Reflective will be met as the app is used because moving
                throughout a site with this type of layout is simple and quick.
